## Session Log

### Session 2026-03-15 (bootstrap)
- Goal: System — project initialization
- Focus: Create project structure, CLAUDE.md, scaffolding
- Done: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, memory files, questions file, directory structure created
- Next: Research session — survey best-fit strategies for Bybit crypto (trend following, mean reversion, carry)
- Questions added: Q-001
- Self-modifications: none (initial setup)

### Session 2026-03-15 research
- Goal: Research — survey strategies, build infrastructure
- Focus: Data analysis of BTC/ETH/SOL 2yr, strategy hypothesis design
- Done: Built lib/data_fetch.py, lib/metrics.py, lib/backtest.py. Fetched 2yr 1h data for BTC/ETH/SOL. Analyzed market characteristics. Created 4 hypotheses: H-001 EMA trend, H-002 BB mean reversion, H-003 cross-asset momentum, H-004 vol breakout. Processed Q-001 user answers (capital $10k-$100k, fully autonomous).
- Next: Backtest H-002 (BB mean reversion) and H-003 (cross-asset momentum) — highest priority given bearish/choppy market
- Questions added: none
- Self-modifications: none

### Session 2026-03-16 backtest
- Goal: Backtest — implement and run H-002 (BB mean reversion) and H-003 (cross-asset momentum)
- Focus: Strategy implementation, parameter sweep backtests on 2yr BTC/ETH/SOL 1h data
- Done: Implemented H-002 (8 param sets) and H-003 (6 param sets). H-002 REJECTED: all negative returns, best Sharpe -0.56. Long-only spot fails in bear market. H-003 REJECTED: best Sharpe 0.33, 3.9% annual, 38.9% DD. Crypto assets too correlated. Added H-005 (funding rate arb) and H-006 (adaptive mean reversion with regime filter + long/short).
- Next: Backtest H-004 (vol breakout) and H-006 (adaptive mean reversion with regime filter) — both use futures long/short which should fare better
- Questions added: none
- Self-modifications: none
